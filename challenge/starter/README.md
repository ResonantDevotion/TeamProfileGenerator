TEAM PROFILE GENERATOR
An app that gathers information about employees and displays the infomation in a HTML webpage. 

Description
This was a project designed to asses and develop our skills in object-oriented programming,test-driven development, javascript, ES6 and node. It had two major components, deconstructing tests and writing the corresponding code, and using inquirer to interactively seek user input, collate and manipukate data, and then create a file, selective displaying the data on a pre-formatted template. The problem that this application solves is the ability to access is chosen employee data and contacts.
